What is it?
------------
The Shopping List App lets shoppers quickly compose a grocery list.

Features
---------
Create Items: A user can create a new grocery item by typing in their item and either clicking on the ‘Add’ button or pressing ‘return’. The new item softly animates onto the screen.

Edit Items: Users are able to edit existing items by clicking on an item’s text. Once they have finished editing an item, they can either press ‘return’ or click out of the item to save the updated text.

Check/Uncheck Items: Users are able to check and uncheck grocery items without having to remove them from the list. Seeing what’s been accomplished is satisfying to the user.

Delete Items: Users can also delete items. The deleted items softly animates off the screen.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive. In the mobile optimized version, the input bar is more aggressively highlighted to clearly point the user to the most important action - creating items.

Visual Design: The flat vector, hero image used for all screen widths was created from scratch.
